# README

This project is an exercise for the Data Analysis with R course, part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. The brief was to download any dataset from (www.gapminder.org/) data and perform some exploratory data analysis, using different types of visualisations.

Thank you to Hans Rosling and [Gapminder](www.gapminder.org) for providing awesome, free datasets and visualisation tools.
