# README

In this project, I use datasets from (www.gapminder.org/) and perform exploratory data analysis, using different types of visualisations.

## Summary of the project

Three datasets are used throughout this project:
 - Life Expectancy at Birth, by country and by year
 - DTP3 Immunization Rates of 1-year-old infants, by country and by year
 - GDP per Capita, by country and by year

I describe each dataset individually, then merge them one by one to uncover correlations between these different metrics.
I conclude that there is a correlation between Life Expectancy and DTP3 Immunization, even with the influence of GDP per capita removed.
